""" You are tasked with developing a digital electronics simulation tool that necessitates the conversion of decimal numbers to binary representation for various computations. As part of this tool, you are required to implement a recursive function to perform the conversion efficiently.



Your objective is to implement a recursive function called decimal_to_binary that converts a given decimal number to its binary equivalent. The function should return the binary representation as a string.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer n, representing the decimal number to be converted.

Output format :
The output consists of a string representing the binary equivalent of the input decimal number.

        return decimal_to_binary(n // 2) + str(n % 2)
